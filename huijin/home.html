 How could my day be bad
when I'm with you?
You're the only one who makes me laugh
So how can my day be bad?
It's a day for you
Lately, life's so boring
I've been watching Netflix all day long
I thought there would be
no things left to watch
so I let myself out
When I went to the park
I recognised you at a glance
Face to face, we just smiled
We already know that we'll be together
How could my day be bad when I'm with you?
You're the only one who makes me laugh
So how can my day be bad?
It's a day for you
Coffee in the morning, you and the sun
There's a brown hue in your eyes
</br>
 How pretty it is
I think I'm in love
When I went to the park
I recognised you at a glance
Face to face, we smiled
and I finally held your hands
</br>
 How could my day be bad when I'm with you?
You're the only one who makes me laugh
So how can my day be bad?
It's a day for you
How could my day be bad when I'm with you?
You're the only one who gives me love
So how can my day be bad?
It's a day for you

    don't know what I've been thinking of
    you know that I would never
    can't build up like I never build
    you know that I will try hard
    give a little love like I never felt
    you know that I would never
    give a little love like I never felt, like I never felt
</br>
    I was in love but I don't wanna try no more
    I've been painfully naive
    we were young but we don't wanna try no more
    But seemed like a good idea
    to fall in, to fall in, to fall in, to fall in
    build me a bridge so I can get over you
    what if I didn't meet you that day?
    I look at you when you look away
    if it's too late I'll go figure out
    I was in love but I don't wanna try no more
    I've been painfully naive
</br>
    we were young but we don't wanna try no more
    but seemed like a good idea
    to fall in, to fall in, to fall in, to fall in
    to fall in, to fall in, to fall in, to fall in
